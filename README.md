# RAG Model

To use the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model, you'll need Python and pip installed on your system. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install pip**: Pip is usually included with Python installations. If it's not installed, follow the instructions on [pip's official website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

3. **Install Required Python Modules**: Use pip to install the necessary modules. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    (keep in mind you need visual studio's c++ build tools and your own API key for AI use)
    pip install langchain-community
    pip install openai
    pip install langchain-chroma
    pip install pypdf
    pip install chromadb
    pip install langchain-openai
    ```
